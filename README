# introduction

animenu is intended as a companion program to the brilliant lirc project.
this program provides a menu system, navigable via an infra-red remote
control and capable of launching programs

arbitrary system commands can be executed in a standalone manner, or in a
file context via filesystem hierarchy navigation

animenu can provide animations for the menus appearing and collapsing, and
uses the Xft extension for (pseudo) translucency

#########
# history

this project was created by Alastair M. Robinson between 2001-2003, where it
reached release version 0.3 with work from several contributors. it was
inspired by 'osdmenu' (Toby Jaffey) but with the original of goal of being
more visually impressive. it bases its OSD code (very loosely) on 'wmix'
(timecop). with no work seen for 10 years, the project was cloned and
re-worked by Pete Beardmore. refer to the ChangeLog file for details
