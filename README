# introduction

animenu is intended as a companion program to the brilliant lirc project.
this program provides a menu system, navigable via an infra-red remote
control and capable of launching programs

arbitrary system commands can be executed in a standalone manner, or in a
file context via filesystem hierarchy navigation

animenu can provide animations for the menus appearing and collapsing, and
uses the Xft extension for (pseudo) translucency

# history

this project was created by Alastair M. Robinson between 2001-2003, where
it reached release version 0.3 with work from several contributors. it was
inspired by 'osdmenu' (Toby Jaffey) but with the original of goal of being
more visually impressive. it bases its OSD code (very loosely) on 'wmix'
(Tim Copperfield). with no work seen for 10 years, the project was cloned
and re-worked by Pete Beardmore. refer to the ChangeLog file for details

# licence

animenu is released under the GPL version 2; for details please see the file

# menu format

menus are configured in plain text files, and take the following format

item
  <title>
  <command>

menu
  <title>
  </path/to/menu>

browse /path/regexp_pattern
  <title>
  <command for selected file>

browse_recurse /path/regexp_pattern
  <title>
  <command for selected file>

see 'examples' directory for inspiration

# issues

-there is currently no protection against circular references in either
sub-menus or filesystem-menus
-excessively long (+1000 character) paths will cause problems. the PATH_MAX
constant in 'limits.h' is not a viable solution, and was replaced by a fixed
1024 limit, which may be tweaked manually in 'animenu.h' dependent on the
filesystem you have in use. this issue may eventually be revisited
-some non-existent fonts (eg. fixed-36) get through the current validity
checking, but render blank
