like much open source Linux software, animenu is distributed as source.
to build and install, it should suffice to execute the following standard
commands:

  ./configure
  make install

issues with incompatible build tools/macros/scripts 'may' be fixed by
regeneration of configure and Makefile*.in files via use of:

  ./bootstrap

the above assumes a fully functional gnu build system

the following options exist for customising animenu at the configure stage:

  disable use Xft, turning off the transparency effect
    --disable-xft [default: system]

  disable use of xpm library for icons
    --disable-icons [default: system]

having installed animenu, you need to adjust your '.lircrc' file to use
any of animenu's supported lirc commands, and also create the entry-
point menu file ('root.menu') as a bare minimum. refer to README file
for further details
