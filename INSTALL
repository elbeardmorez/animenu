Like much open source Linux software, animenu must be built from source.
This entails the following steps from a console:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

The following options exist for customising animenu at the configure stage:

  --disable-xft
Turns off the transparency effect, and allows linking without Xft.

This feature will be automatically disabled if the appropriate
libraries are not available.

Once you've compiled and installed animenu, you will also have to adjust
your .lircrc file - the commands supported by irmix are detailed in the
README file.

You will also need to create some menus.  There are some examples in the
example menus directory - you might like to copy this directory to ~/.animenu
to get a feel for what AniMenu can do.
