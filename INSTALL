like much open source Linux software, animenu is distributed as source. to
build and install it, execute the following standard commands from a console:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

the following options exist for customising animenu at the configure stage:

  disable use Xft, turning off the transparency effect
    --disable-xft [default: system]

  disable use of xpm library for icons
    --disable-icons [default: system]

having installed animenu, you need to adjust your '.lircrc' file to use any
of the supported animenu commands (see README file for details), and as a
minimum create a root.menu file (see README file for details)
